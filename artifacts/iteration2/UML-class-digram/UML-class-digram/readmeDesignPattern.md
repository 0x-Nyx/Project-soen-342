# Why We Used the Singleton Pattern for Admin

In our system, there is only one administrator who manages everything, like approving clients, updating records and handling expert information. Since we should never have more than one admin at a time, using the Singleton design pattern makes the more sense.

## Benefits of Singleton in Our Case

1. **Ensures Only One Admin Exists**  
   - The system requires a single admin account, so Singleton prevents multiple instances.

2. **Prevents Data Inconsistencies**  
   - If there were multiple `Admin` objects, they could have different usernames or passwords, leading to authentication issues.

3. **Efficient Memory Usage**  
   - Instead of creating multiple admin objects so we create only one instance, which is reused throughout the system.

4. **Global Access**  
   - The admin needs to be accessible from different parts of the system and Singleton makes sure thereâ€™s always one instance available.
